# 3D Portfolio

Welcome to the 3D Portfolio project! This project combines a React front-end created with Deno, Hono, React, TypeScript, and Three.js, along with a corresponding backend. Below are the instructions for setting up and running both the front-end and the backend locally.

## Front-end Setup

Make sure you have the backend running from [3D_Portfolio_Backend](https://github.com/Rubengastjeuh/3D_Portfolio_Backend) to test locally.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rubengastjeuh/3D_Portfolio_Frontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 3D_Portfolio_Frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

   The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

5. Build the app for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This command creates a production-ready build in the `build` folder. Your app is now ready for deployment.

## Backend Setup

Make sure to follow the instructions in the [3D_Portfolio_Backend](https://github.com/Rubengastjeuh/3D_Portfolio_Backend) repository to set up and deploy the backend.

For online purposes, feel free to customize the backend, and templates for POST, UPDATE, and DELETE operations are provided.

Enjoy exploring and showcasing your 3D Portfolio! If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the respective README files for each part of the project.
